# Lab 1: MapReduce
My solutions for the MIT Course [Distributed Systems](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/)

To run the test:  
`$ sh test-mr.sh 2> /dev/null `

The `2> /dev/null` part can bypass some verbose error message.

The output will be something like this:  
  
*** Starting wc test.  
--- wc test: PASS  
*** Starting indexer test.  
--- indexer test: PASS  
*** Starting map parallelism test.  
--- map parallelism test: PASS  
*** Starting reduce parallelism test.  
--- reduce parallelism test: PASS  
*** Starting crash test.  
--- crash test: PASS  
*** PASSED ALL TESTS
